# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# > You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
